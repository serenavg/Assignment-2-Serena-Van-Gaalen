      <p>First semester at university has been fun but challenging. There are a lot of projects assigned, a lot of
        papers to read and write, and not enough time in the day. I've made some great friends and already have amazing
        memories though. Because I have met so many great people, univeristy is a lot of fun. </p>

      <h2>The Cult Leader</h2>
      <p>It has been a good place for me so far. I'm learning a lot in my classes, and I'm learning even more about
        myself and the world.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.uleth.ca">U of L</a> has always been on my radar as a post-secondary school to attend,
        considering I have lived here in Lethbridge my whole life. As of right now I'm pretty sure I made the right
        decision in coming here. There is a lot to do and explore around campus</p>
