      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Lethbridge, Alberta. Some of my favourite things to do around the Southern Alberta
        area are <a href="https://www.skicastle.ca/">skiing,</a> <a
          href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/waterton/activ/experiences/randonee-hiking"> hiking</a>, camping, and
        fishing. I played soccer for about 10 years and I 've been a referee for almost 4 years now.</p>
      <p>I went to Briercrest college for a semester (fall 2021), but I realized it wasn't the place I wanted to be. So
        I took some time off from school, worked, and took time to relax and learn about myself. In about May 2022 I was
        looking at what to do in the fall. The New Media program caught my interest because I saw a class that was on
        memes. I wanted to do art and I figured this program is the most likely out of any art degree to get me a job
        after.</p>

      <p>First semester at university has been fun but challenging. There are a lot of projects assigned, a lot of
        papers to read and write, and not enough time in the day. I've made some great friends and already have amazing
        memories though. Because I have met so many great people, univeristy is a lot of fun. </p>

      <h2>University of Lethbridge</h2>
      <p>It has been a good place for me so far. I'm learning a lot in my classes, and I'm learning even more about
        myself and the world.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.uleth.ca">U of L</a> has always been on my radar as a post-secondary school to attend,
        considering I have lived here in Lethbridge my whole life. As of right now I'm pretty sure I made the right
        decision in coming here. There is a lot to do and explore around campus</p>
